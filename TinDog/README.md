# Bootstrap TinDog Website 

By [Raquel Cruickshank](https://github.com/cruickshankrpc) from *The Complete Web Development Bootcamp* by [Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer).

## Overview 

Fun little exercise from a Udemy course I'm taking online to consolidate my learning from [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)'s Software Engineering Immersive.

### Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

I enjoyed using the Bootstrap CSS framework (I had only used Bulma before) for its in-built mobile-responsiveness, learning about combined class selectors, and refactoring my CSS with classes.
